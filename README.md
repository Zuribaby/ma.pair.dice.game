Group Capstone Project: Re-Creating a Dice Game
The goal of this project is to create a browser-based dice game that improves upon an existing design. You are encouraged to explore this Dice Game for inspiration and come up with ways to enhance its functionality, interactivity, and user experience.

Your game should involve at least two players who roll the dice in turns, with the game state being updated and displayed dynamically on the webpage.

Requirements:

Game Rules & Mechanics: Establish clear rules and mechanics for your game. Consider how many dice will be rolled, how turns will rotate, what determines a win, and so forth.
User Interactions: Your game must support user interactions. This could be through buttons (e.g., ‘Roll Dice’, ‘New Game’, ‘Hold’), and these actions should trigger corresponding game mechanics.
DOM Manipulation: The game state must be clearly displayed on the webpage and should be updated dynamically in response to the game’s progress.
Game State Management: Efficiently manage and update the game state in your JavaScript code. This might include keeping track of each player’s score, whose turn it is, and who has won.
Improve Existing Design: Identify one or more ways you can improve upon the design of the existing Dice Game. This could involve enhancing the gameplay mechanics, improving the UI/UX, or adding new features entirely.
Error Handling: Implement suitable error handling for scenarios like invalid input or game state.
Validation: Make sure the game behaves correctly in all situations, the logic is foolproof and there are no bugs.
This project will test your abilities to create and manage dynamic interactions with users, update the DOM in response to changes, and maintain game state – skills that are fundamental to many types of JavaScript development. Remember, creativity is encouraged, and the primary goal is to make something that is not only functional, but also fun to play!
